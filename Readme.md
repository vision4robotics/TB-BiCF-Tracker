# Learning Temporary Block-Based Bidirectional Incongruity-Aware Correlation Filters for Efficient UAV Object Tracking

Matlab implementation of our Temporary Block-Based Bidirectional Incongruity-Aware Correlation Filters (TB-BiCF) tracker.

It's an extended version of [BICF tracker](https://github.com/vision4robotics/BiCF-Tracker).
